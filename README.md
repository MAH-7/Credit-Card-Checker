## 📍 Overview

<code>❯ This project implements a credit card validation and correction system using the Luhn algorithm. The system can identify valid and invalid credit card numbers and convert invalid ones into valid numbers. This functionality is useful for ensuring that credit card numbers are correctly formatted before processing transactions.</code>

---

## 👾 Features

<code>❯ Key features of the Credit Card Checker project include:</code>

- Validate credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm.
- Identify and return invalid credit card numbers from a given batch.
- Convert invalid credit card numbers into valid ones.
- Support for various card companies like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.

## 🎯 Project Goals

**Context**: The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but you’ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!

As you progress through the steps, use the terminal and `console.log()` statements to check the output of your loops and functions.
